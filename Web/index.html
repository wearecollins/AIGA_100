				<div class="quoteInner">In 1980, I designed a poster for the high school winter play, <span class="italic">Death of a Salesman</span>. Our library had one book on graphic design, so I studied it endlessly. Unfortunately, the book was about Nazi propaganda posters. I look at that poster now—solid black background, high contrast image of Willy Loman—and it clearly looks like Hitler.</div>

				<div class="quoteInner">It was my senior year in high school when I ran for class president. Honestly, my opponent was much more qualified, but my posters were more legible and the typography had a feeling of responsibility and vision. It’s amazing what all caps can do.</div>

				<div class="quoteInner">When I was 16, I created a monthly comic series for my school paper. In each installment a different classmate was eaten by a terribly drawn zombie.

				<div class="quoteInner">When I was 18, I was a toll collector for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority in East Boston at the entrance of the Callahan tunnel. During a particularly sweltering summer, while walking on the catwalk inside the tunnel so motorists could see me breathing and be reassured that the air quality inside the tunnel was good, I promised myself I would never take another job that did not utilize my artistic talent. I never did, and I have been gainfully employed as a graphic designer ever since.</div>

				<div class="quoteInner">I believe all of those early rock posters were collaborations. As far as I can remember, we’d pass them back and forth; sometimes we’d work together and fight over the pencil. Michael, bigger than me, usually won out. A lot of them were done on Cronan’s table in his bedroom at his parents’ house. Clumsy, but Michael’s emerging design skills are apparent.</div>

				<div class="quoteInner">From almost the first time I met her, Sylvia became one of my favorite people. Sylvia was sampling the various ways to be a designer and I suggested she sample the nonprofit environment at WGBH. I think it was 1977. What I recall is not what she worked on, but what she was like. She was so bright, so natural, so positive and so hungry to learn that it was clear to us she was going to be somebody important and that she should go back to school. And she did. Her brief time with us [at WGBH] felt like a transition, a launching pad for what she chose to become.</div>

				<div class="quoteInner">As a young boy, in the 1950s, I started designing elaborate chemistry experiments in my parents’ basement, filling the house with foul odors and scary smoke. I moved on to building tree houses and elaborate tunnel complexes. My first “serious design” job, after graduating from Parsons, was with Unimark International—1968—one of the most remarkable marketing communications firms in the world. Massimo and Lella Vignelli were two of the managing partners.</div>

However, I abandoned this by the time I hit junior high school and didn’t pick it up again until design school in 1971. That year I began again to design real and imaginary places and objects, even social structures, as part of my wide-ranging design curriculum—environmental design—at Parsons.</div>

I stood next to Alfred Eisenstaedt as he held the photographs he took for Life magazine in his hands. And I ate egg salad sandwiches with Jackie Onassis as we laid out the pictures and text for her book, In the Russian Style. I realized that publication design was a whole world of lifetimes.</div>
